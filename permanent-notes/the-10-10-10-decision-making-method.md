# The 10-10-10 decision-making method

Suzy Welch suggests a decision-making method called "ten ten ten" in her book ([[suzy-welch-on-10-10-10]]). The numbers stand for ten minutes, ten days, and ten years. With the method, you consider the consequences of the decision for each period. To get the most authentic results, you should first define your values. Defining your values isn't exactly easy, so Welch also suggests three questions to help with that:

1. What would make you cry from regret on your 75th birthday?
2. What do you want people to say about you when you're not in the room?
3. What did you love or hate about your childhood?
